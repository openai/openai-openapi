## Properties

| Name | Type | Description | Notes |
|------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
|**model** | **String** | ID of the model to use. You can use the [List models](/docs/api-reference/models/list) API to see all of your available models, or see our [Model overview](/docs/models/overview) for descriptions of them. |  |
|**prompt** | [**CreateCompletionRequestPrompt**](CreateCompletionRequestPrompt.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**suffix** | **String** | The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text. |  [optional] |
|**maxTokens** | **Integer** | The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) to generate in the completion.  The token count of your prompt plus &#x60;max_tokens&#x60; cannot exceed the model&#39;s context length. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens (except for the newest models, which support 4096).  |  [optional] |
|**temperature** | **BigDecimal** | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.  We generally recommend altering this or &#x60;top_p&#x60; but not both.  |  [optional] |
|**topP** | **BigDecimal** | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.  We generally recommend altering this or &#x60;temperature&#x60; but not both.  |  [optional] |
|**n** | **Integer** | How many completions to generate for each prompt.  **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for &#x60;max_tokens&#x60; and &#x60;stop&#x60;.  |  [optional] |
|**stream** | **Boolean** | Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format) as they become available, with the stream terminated by a &#x60;data: [DONE]&#x60; message.  |  [optional] |
|**logprobs** | **Integer** | Include the log probabilities on the &#x60;logprobs&#x60; most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if &#x60;logprobs&#x60; is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the &#x60;logprob&#x60; of the sampled token, so there may be up to &#x60;logprobs+1&#x60; elements in the response.  The maximum value for &#x60;logprobs&#x60; is 5. If you need more than this, please contact us through our [Help center](https://help.openai.com) and describe your use case.  |  [optional] |
|**echo** | **Boolean** | Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion  |  [optional] |
|**stop** | [**CreateCompletionRequestStop**](CreateCompletionRequestStop.md) |  |  [optional] |
|**presencePenalty** | **BigDecimal** | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model&#39;s likelihood to talk about new topics.  [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/api-reference/parameter-details)  |  [optional] |
|**frequencyPenalty** | **BigDecimal** | Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model&#39;s likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.  [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/api-reference/parameter-details)  |  [optional] |
|**bestOf** | **Integer** | Generates &#x60;best_of&#x60; completions server-side and returns the \&quot;best\&quot; (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.  When used with &#x60;n&#x60;, &#x60;best_of&#x60; controls the number of candidate completions and &#x60;n&#x60; specifies how many to return – &#x60;best_of&#x60; must be greater than &#x60;n&#x60;.  **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for &#x60;max_tokens&#x60; and &#x60;stop&#x60;.  |  [optional] |
|**logitBias** | **Object** | Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.  Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view&#x3D;bpe) (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.  As an example, you can pass &#x60;{\&quot;50256\&quot;: -100}&#x60; to prevent the &lt;|endoftext|&gt; token from being generated.  |  [optional] |
|**user** | **String** | A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to monitor and detect abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices/end-user-ids).  |  [optional] |
