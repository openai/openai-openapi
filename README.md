## Realtime API

The Realtime API allows you to receive real-time updates and notifications from the OpenAI platform. This can be useful for applications that need to respond to events as they happen.

### Overview

The Realtime API provides endpoints to subscribe to various events and receive updates in real-time. You can use this API to build applications that react to changes in the OpenAI platform as they occur.

### Usage

To use the Realtime API, you need to subscribe to the events you are interested in. The API will then send updates to your application as the events occur.

For more details on the Realtime API, including endpoints, request parameters, and response schemas, please refer to the [realtime-api.yaml](realtime-api.yaml) file.
